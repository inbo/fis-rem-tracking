NEW REPO FOR ANIMAL TRACKING BY STUDENTS

-------------------------------------------------

How to get already-tracked seqID from the old system?
	Check Agouti export: obs of seq with angle/radius/speed already tracked
		Get these seqID
			Add these to seq_done
	Obs of seq without angel/radius/speed
		Check again so they get into seq_done
For DRG and MRD
ZS will be with the new system immediately

---------------------------------------------------

Get 3 seq_done files, 1 for each
	This way, all 3 students can work on their project at the same time without creating conflicts
Get 3 scripts, 1 for each
	Idem above

Workflow
1. Get photos with sticks from the field
2. Upload
3. ASAP: Identify Camera Calibration sequences
	No specific need to already calibrate, can just annotate and leave open
	When actually calibrated: VALIDATED
		This way, easy filter to find the ones that were annotated but not yet calibrated
4. Annotate
(3 and 4 can be done continuously throughout the study period, you'll just need new exports from time to time to get the new data)
Once enough study species annotated:
5. Run animal_tracking script for study area
	Update: Use filter(type == cameraCalibration) to get the list of deps that have sticks
		Use this to filter deps to study period
		Use this then to filter for study species
		Open each obs with for-loop an TRACK
When everything from current export tracked, make new export with new calibrations and new annotations
6. Save seq_done
